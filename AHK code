This is the code I used to make this script work. I know it's not optimal but I made this on the go, will improve it later.

#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.


; Do you also hate getting kicked to the hub while afk'ing?
; Then this script is for you! 
; It automatically sends the /joinqueue command every minute to make sure you can afk all night long without getting kicked for long.
; Just use one of the commands (kingdomafk, westernafk, utopiaafk, mysticafk, jurassicafk or blizzardafk) to start the script.
; I commented on the kingdomafk script to show you what does what so you can edit it yourself, just make sure that you don't make the wait time too short or you might get kicked/banned for spamming commands.
; For now it doesn't allow use on multiple windows, only 1 minecraft can be open at once. I might add multiaccount support later if I feel like it.
; Enjoy the script! - AnimeFreak0710 (IGN: Luke_van_R)
