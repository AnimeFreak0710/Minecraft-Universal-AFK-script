# Minesaga-afk-script
Do you also hate getting kicked to the hub while afk'ing?
Then this script is for you! 
It automatically sends the /joinqueue command every minute to make sure you can afk all night long without getting kicked for long.
I also added some other features like automatic selling using the /sell all command!

If you want to make sure it works, you can also open a text editor (notepad for example) and it should type the command when it's activated.
If it works in the text editor you can just open the minecraft window and it should continue working just fine.

The variables are easily editable, just make sure that you don't make the wait time too short or you might get kicked/banned for spamming commands. Remember! The wait time is displayed in milliseconds!

For now it doesn't allow use on multiple accounts, only 1 minecraft window can be open at once and it must be the active window (can't be paused or in inventory as well). I might add multiaccount support later if I feel like it.

You'll need the software AutoHotKey from https://autohotkey.com/download to run and/or compile the script.

I'll include an .exe version of the script so you can run it without downloading any additional software, but I recommend compiling the script yourself so you can edit it and check for errors.


Any feedback is appreciated!

Enjoy the script! - AnimeFreak0710 (IGN: Luke_van_R)

P.S. Somehow the afk script doesn't continue when the autosell script is activated, I'm still trying to figure that out.
