# Minesaga-afk-script
Do you also hate getting kicked to the hub while afk'ing?
Then this script is for you! 
It automatically sends any command you want every minute to so you can always reconnect.

If you want to make sure it works, you can also open a text editor (notepad for example) and it should type the command when it's activated.
If it works in the text editor you can just open the minecraft window and it should continue working just fine.

You can put in any 2 commands you want and change the delay values. Just make sure that you don't make the wait time too short or you might get kicked/banned for spamming commands. I recommend a minimum of 10 seconds in between every command.

For now it doesn't allow use on multiple accounts, only 1 minecraft window can be open at once and it must be the active window (can't be paused or in inventory as well). I might add multiaccount support later if I feel like it.

You'll need the software AutoHotKey from https://autohotkey.com/download to run and/or compile the script.

I'll include an .exe version of the script so you can run it without downloading any additional software, but I recommend compiling the script yourself so you can edit it and check for errors.


Any feedback is appreciated!

Enjoy the script! - AnimeFreak0710 (IGN: Luke_van_R)
